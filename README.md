# API REST MonCash
Vous pouvez choisir l'option de votre choix

# Introduction
Integrate the MonCash API with one click into your site. 
I have built everything for you in this package. 
You only have to read the MD file, and you will understand everything.

# USAGE
Use this URL in the REST API when in test mode: sandbox.moncashbutton.digicelgroup.com/Api, 
and for the live mode you can use this: moncashbutton.digicelgroup.com/Api.

# MonCash Gateway Base URL
The GATEWAY_BASE can be https://moncashbutton.digicelgroup.com/Moncash-middleware for live and
https://sandbox.moncashbutton.digicelgroup.com/Moncash-middleware for test.

# Authentication
Create an account on the MonCash website. You can use the test version of the API.
If everything worked for you in the test version, you can now use the live performance. For this, you must first call MonCash so that it explains all the procedures to follow.
